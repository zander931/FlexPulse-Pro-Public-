# Flex Pulse Pro Knee Sleeve
This futuristic post knee surgery information technology monitors the function and 
stress on the knee in real time, sending data to a mobile app.

Pre-processed and cleaned data is saved locally in a .csv file.

The measured attributes include the knee flexion angle using a flexion sensor, in 
addition to heart rate and temperature sensors to measure the cardiovascular 
stress and estimating local blood flow to the region.

The Flex Pulse Pro knee sleeve allows for healthcare professionals and consultants 
to monitor the recovery of patients, assess the restrictions to a normal gait 
pattern as well as suggest further exercises or treatment plans.
